Approach:
Initialize the answer variable (ans) with the sum of the first three elements in the sorted array.
Sort the input array to make it easier to traverse.
Use a nested loop with two pointers (j and k) to iterate through the array and find the sum closest to the target.
Update the answer if a closer sum is found.

Time Complexity: O(n^2) - The nested loop iterates through the array with two pointers.

Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space is used.
