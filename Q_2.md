Approach:
Use a min-heap to maintain the k largest elements.
Iterate through the input array, pushing elements into the heap until its size reaches k.
If the current element is larger than the smallest element in the heap, replace the smallest element with the current one.
Return the top element of the heap, which is the kth largest element.

Time Complexity: O(n log k) - Each insertion into the priority queue takes log k time, and we do it for n elements. I couldn't think of a better solution but I believe that this solution is very efficient if k << n.

Space Complexity: O(k) - The size of the priority queue.
