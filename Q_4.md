Approach:
Maintain a variable mj (max jump) to represent the farthest index that can be reached.
Iterate through the array, updating mj with the maximum of the current value plus its index and the current mj.
If at any point, mj becomes less than the current index, break the loop since it is not possible to reach that index.
Check if mj is greater than or equal to the last index of the array. If true, return true; otherwise, return false.

Time Complexity: O(n) - Iterating through the array once.

Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space used.
